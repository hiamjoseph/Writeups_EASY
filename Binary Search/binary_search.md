## 📁 Description

Binary Search is a guessing game, i'm not sure if i had to write some C program
to guess the correct number or modify the already existing code.

## ✅ Solution

Guess the right number.

### 🧠 Approach

For this challenge, i don't know if i had to write some C program or a bash
script.

What I did do was simply guess the right number.

The program will tell you if you need to go higher or lowe, be carefull; you
only get 10 guesses, which is very sufficent if you know how to use them.
