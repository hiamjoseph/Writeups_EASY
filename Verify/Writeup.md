## üìÅ Description

The goal of the challenge is to use the SHA-256 hashing function to check which
file is legitimate, hence containing the real flag.

## ‚úÖ Solution

The file to be decrypted is _e018b574_. It contains the flag.

### üß† Approach

The _challenge.zip_ contains a _checksum.txt_ file; it contains a SHA-256 hash.
You can either use the `sha256sum *` in your 'files' folder command to display
all the hashes for the files. Decrypt the one with the same hash in the
_checksum.txt_ file.

---

OR

Write a sript to automate the check.

### üíª Commands

```bash
sha256sum <filename>
```

```bash
./decrypt.sh files/e018b574
```

### ‚úåüèæ Additional tips

If you get a `error at newline` error, use the built-in webshell. Don't try to
debug the _decrypt.sh_ file.
