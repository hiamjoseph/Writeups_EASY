## üìÅ Description

> Are overflows just a stack concern?

Use your C knowledge to solve this challenge.

## ‚úÖ Solution

Write a 17 byte string to the input. NO SPACES.

### üß† Approach

The key to solving this challenge is reading the source code.

Upon close inspection of the code, you'll find that `scanf()` in the
`writet_buffer` function isn't inside any `if` checks, in other words, it's not
properly validated.

Our two variables addresses are `0x6000035b0030` and `0x6000035b0040`. The
difference is `0x10` or 16 in decimal.

This time, choose the second option of writing to the buffer.

Input any string that's longer than 16 bytes, and the flag is yours.

### üíª Commands

If you decide to only use the source code, you'll have to compile the program
yourself.

use `gcc <sourcecode>`

### ‚úåüèæ Additional tips

This challenge requires a good understanding of the C language. Dynamic memory
allocation and pointers.
