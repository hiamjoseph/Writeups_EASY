## 📁 Description

> Are overflows just a stack concern?

## ✅ Solution

Write a 33 byte string to the input.

### 🧠 Approach

For this challenge, i don't know if i had to write some C program or a bash
script.

What I did do was simply guess the right number.

The program will tell you if you need to go higher or lowe, be carefull; you
only get 10 guesses, which is very sufficent if you know how to use them.
