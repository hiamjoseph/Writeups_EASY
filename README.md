# picoCTF Challenges

## Welcome!

This repo is all about me getting introduced to CTFs, I'll be documenting my
journey with overall Cybersec concepts.

## What's pico?

Pico is a platform where cybersecurity enthusiasts of all levels come together
to learn, practice, and engage in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. Currently,
I use Pico primarily for practicing and familiarizing myself with CTFs and the
broader field of digital security.

Feel free to message me about anything.
