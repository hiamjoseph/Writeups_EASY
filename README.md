# picoCTF Challenges

## Welcome!

This repo is all about me getting introduced to CTFs, I'll be documenting my
journey with overall Cybersec concepts.

## What's pico?

pico, from my understanding is a place where cybersec enthusiasts of all levels
gather to learn practice and participate in CTF challenges; I currently only use
it to practice and getting introduced to CTFs and the world of digital securtiy.

Feel free to message me about anything.
