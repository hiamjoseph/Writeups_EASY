## 📁 Description

> Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?

## ✅ Solution

Past the code in the browser's console.

### 🧠 Approach

Thankfully, i understand a little bit of javascript.

There's an `alert()` function in te code. It's usually used to prompt the user
with something; in this case, our flag.

### 💻 Commands

NO COMMANDS WERE USED.

### ✌🏾 Additional tips

The console won't let you past code in the console, they'll let you know how to
bypass that.

Alternatively, creat a new project, and execute your javascript code there.
